At the moment this is a super pre-mature release of this codebase basically because the code here is useful imo.  
Working ATM:  
- My own implementation of hash-Moe: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04426.pdf  
- Basic Dense Transformers  
- Various Iterable Loaders and prepare dataset scripts  
- An Encoder Transformer Useful for Classification
- other bits and bobs
